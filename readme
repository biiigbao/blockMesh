blockMesh
=========
Matlab toolbox for generating block structured hex meshes in the polyMesh file format of OpenFOAM.

The "Core" of the code is block.m which generates a structure containing the information required 
to write the OpenFOAM polyMesh files. 

The file mergeBlocks.m takes such two block structures and merges them into a single structure.

The file writePolyMesh.m writes the OpenFOAM files points, faces, owner, neighbour and boundary.

The folder "meshes" contains examples of uses of the different tools in the "meshingTools" folder.
